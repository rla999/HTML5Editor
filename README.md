# HTML5Editor
Class project for Java OOP. Done as a group with two other people. So far, integrates the mechanism to generate code for and save to a file for the image, link, and table components.

<h2>Changelog:</h2>
<h3>v0.1 - 03/25/2019</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I am personally responsible for designing and coding the table component.</li>
  <li>Two separate Java classes -- one for the main table dialog and second for the table editor which is a JFrame containing some JPanels including one with a JTable that lets the user visually fill in the table cells, much like in Excel.</li>
  <li>The save button implentation in the table editor dialog is <em>not yet</em> functional. When it is, it should output the table data as an HTML string that is inserted into the main HTML textarea in the table dialog.</li>
  </ul>
